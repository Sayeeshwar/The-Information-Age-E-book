        <p><b>Limitations Of the Internet</b><br><br>
 
</p>
<p>
The internet has several advantages and just as many drawbacks as explained. To start things off, there is a lot of false information on the internet. There are a lot of scammers online that spread false information quite convincingly. Some examples are the phishing emails about the urgent money transfers in some African bank.</p>

<p>The state of data privacy isn't very great. There have been lot of data leaks recently. These suggest that whatever we put into the internet is never truly safe and could be stolen. Personal information thefts are common place unless you have good security software.</p>

<p> The amount of malware on the internet is unbelievable too. Without good anti-virus software, your computer might be affected very easily. And finally, the internet is running out of storage. The internet does have its share of drawbacks. </p>
