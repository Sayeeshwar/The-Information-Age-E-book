        <p>Efficiency in the workplace has improved many folds due to implementation of technology in the office.  One main improvement is communication. Now, people can work from home. This is referred to as telecommuting. Employees can work over the internet and thus have the freedom to be anywhere in the world (with an internet connection!) while doing so.</p>
        <p> And with so much information at hand, collecting data has become a breeze. Tele commuting has become so popular that over 70%  of all work teams are virtual working from another place. And because employees can be at home (comfortable surroundings), there is a chance that productivity might be higher. Of course, that is still a theory, because many of us can get distracted if no one is supervising!
