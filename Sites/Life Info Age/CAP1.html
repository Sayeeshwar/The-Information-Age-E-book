        The police have stepped up their game significantly due to ICT. All officers are trained to use ICT systems for their jobs. Communication is much better due to secure digital radios and an accurate digital dispatch system. However the criminals have become much better too.<br><br> The types of crimes committed nowadays are mostly cyber crimes. This is because it doesn't involve much of physical risk and can be highly rewarding. In many areas, as ICT is not yet very developed, it is easy for cyber criminals to get away.

        The forensic department has also grown tremendously. A significant development is DNA analysis as well as fingerprint information. These allow the police to keep track and identify suspects.
