  CCTV cameras allow us to record what happens as evidence. However, with all the data being collected, people are increasingly beginning to worry about their privacy, with the latest data leaks raising a lot of eyebrows. Data filtering tools allow vast amounts of data to be accessed easily. All this is good for the society, but a lot of people complain that the police is becoming too tech savvy and dependant to an extent where they might not be very efficient without them.

        <p><b>
        In conclusion</b><br>Although all of us are very worried about how major organizations handle our data, nobody really takes any action against it. However, we feel very safe that the police have updated and are much better with ICT. At least that is what I feel.
