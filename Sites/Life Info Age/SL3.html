 <b> Social life</b></p>

<p>However, there is a better argument for how ICT has improved our social life. One major development is the creation of online dating websites and social networks. This has enabled a lot of people to meet their partners online. One example is the mobile app Tinder. This helps you to meet people in your locality of your choice. </p>

<p>You can then chat with them or meet in person. In my case, I managed to find some of my old friends on Facebook whom I had lost contact with. In the end, it is up to you whether you want to use it for the good or bad.</p>
<p> In conclusion, the effect of technology of social life is very profound. Some say it has a positive influence, most others say otherwise. A lot of time is wasted by people on social networks while it has enabled many people to meet new people. The overall aspect differs mainly from person to person</p>
