        <p>I am sure everyone has played the Play station. It's wildly famous and is at the top of the best-selling gaming consoles list. Don't believe me? See for yourself.

This is what mostly goes for entertainment these days. The way people pass their time has vastly changed compared to what it was 50 years ago. Back then, we read a book, actually went out (yeah, people did it then) or listened to the radio. No Netflix or any video games.
