<b>Data modeling</b></p>
<p>
With advanced data modeling tools, we can predict the trends of a situation. For example, the health department can predict the effect of a disease in an area and decide how to allocate resources accordingly.</p>


<p><b> Drawbacks</b><br>There are certain drawbacks to ICT in medicine as well. For instance, if the network goes down, it is going to be very difficult to work at the same rate. Next, all the staff need to be trained to use the new ICT system. However, the main worry is the cost to set all this up. It would be a very expensive process.</p>

<p><b>
Overall picture</b><br>
As of today, almost anything can be cured and with all the advanced research going on, finding cures for all diseases seems likely. The public feel assured that everything can be attended to by the medicine department with its latest tech. however, if it relies too much on ICT, how efficient would it be without it?</p>
