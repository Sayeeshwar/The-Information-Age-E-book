    <p>Technology
The main way ICT has helped medicine is by coming up with new machines that make diagnosis and treatment a lot less painful, time consuming and boring. An example of this is the MRI scanner. There have been several other inventions too such as EEG, ECG monitors and X-ray machines</p>

<b>Record keeping</b></p>
<p>
No more inefficient patient records that are stored in those old and deteriorating files! With the digital revolution, data basing of patient records has becoming a breeze. With cloud storage and a network of hospitals across the country, the health department can keep track of each patient's unique characteristics, with the freedom of updating and accessing it from any centre. In the UK, patients have the right to access their health records and make sure everything is synchronized and up to date.</p>
