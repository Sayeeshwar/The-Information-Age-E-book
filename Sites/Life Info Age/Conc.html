 <b> In the End,</b></p>
 <p>
We have largely replaced everything in our lives with ICT. This has caused our lives to become much easier and efficient. However, due to flaws in the society, criminals can take advantage of the latest technology to do criminal activities. Also, many question the dependency of the human race on computers and how good we would be without them. It is upto us how we lead our lives. Their controlling us ....or Them in our control.
