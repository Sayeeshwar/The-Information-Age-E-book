<p>I think that picture provided conclusive evidence as to how big the divide is. As per the graph, the divide is narrowing, but at a small rate. And the overall rate is increasing considerably only because of the growth in developed countries.<br><br> The rate of growth in developing countries is still low. So, the conclusive assessment of the digital divide globally can be said that although the world is working hard to bridge the gap, the overall effect is not that great. However, hope should not be lost as many people are being benefitted by the efforts to get people online. </p>
