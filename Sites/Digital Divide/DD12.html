        <p><b>Conclusion -Digital Divide</b></p>

                <p><b>Effects of the divide:</b>
Many people have spoken in favor of bridging the divide and how it will affect the economy. 
Bill Clinton said that providing internet access throughout the world will do a lot to reduce income inequality. Kofi Annan stated that 'Information technology is a powerful force that must be harnessed'. He mentioned that new economies can only be productive if the power spreads worldwide and responds to the needs of everyone.</p>

<p>Economically, this affects a lot of people, mainly in terms of employment. Since everyone does not have access, the people who have it have an edge. For job employment, jobs in the neighborhood can be found easily using the internet. So those who are on the other side of the divide would lack a valuable resource.
