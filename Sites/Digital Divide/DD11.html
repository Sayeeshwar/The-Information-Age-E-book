        <p>Bridging the Digital Divide In NYC</p>

                <p>
				
                You might be surprised to know that the digital divide even occurs inside the most famous city 	 				in the world- New York City. The divide occurs within the rich and affluent portion of the city 				 and the poor neighborhoods and low-income households</p>
                
                <p> At a recent Tech crunch conference, the mayor announced that he plans to make New York completely connected by 2025. $	70 million have been pledged for this initiative for the next 10 years. He also plans to have around 1500 internet kiosks around the city through which calls can be made using touchscreens</p>
                <p> Hopefully, this would close the gap in the city and in time, eliminate the divide
