<b>                Global Measures</b><br>Many organizations have come up with solutions to close the gap. Many of them work, many of them don't. One of the more efficient ones is the Daknet initiative in India and Cambodia. As tech infrastructure is quite scarce there, their solution is to make local transport vehicles as mobile internet access points complete with a wifi router and a computer. The vehicles go on a fixed path every day. Due to this brilliant solution, many hundreds of people are getting internet access and are more connected with the society.
