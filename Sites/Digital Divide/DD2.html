        <p>The digital divide in an area is directly linked to the economy there. If a society is economically backward, they don't need ICT to improve their lives as there is very little scope to do so. This is because they are more worried about their day to day survival rather than development in the ICT department.

        <p>Often, the equipment needed is excessively expensive to connect to the internet and use technology. So nobody is prepared to invest their hard earned cash on something they don't need yet.</p>
