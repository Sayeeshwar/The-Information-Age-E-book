        <p>Seriously, how many movies have been made on superior tech that dominates the human race! Let's see, I Robot, Transcendence and many more I cannot remember. Anyways, that number is way too high and partially, they are right about how technology can be scary. There are people in the world who are literally scared because of such advanced technology in today's world.

        <p>With so many data privacy issues and technology invading every second of your life, it's a wonder so many people are actually into it. In rural areas mainly, where many people are uneducated they view technology as something alien and dangerous </p>
