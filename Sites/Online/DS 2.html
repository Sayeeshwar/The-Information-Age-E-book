<b>Films:</b><br>
Similar to music, the theatre industry has taken a hit since the introduction of downloadable film content. The major players are iTunes, Google Movies. Once again, there is an option of streaming on demand content. One very good example is the Netflix, which has become wildly popular in the USA for watching the latest TV shows.</p>
<p><b>Software upgrades:</b>
Majority of software upgrades are done over the internet nowadays. We all upgrade our mobile OS over the air. Also, support for software suites are done through the internet, by providing support files on their websites. Mobile gaming services have extension packs that can be downloaded.</p>
