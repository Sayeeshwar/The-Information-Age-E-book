    		<p>Recently, the functionality of messaging services has vastly improved. Users can send files across to each other as well as conduct a video chat. Also, a useful feature is emojis, which allow users to express their feelings through pictures such as different types of smilies and cartoons</p>
            
            <p>There are different statuses a person can show: available, busy, not active are a few of them. The user can also scroll through their past messages and conversations. Currently, the services are quite advanced and are very convenient. Future scope includes, free voice calls. We are more dependent on them than we would like to admit, as many trillions of text messages get sent every year. For the near feature, this doesn't seem to stop.

</p>            
<p>Therefore, instant messaging  services are proving to be very useful and so are very popular. Although this spells doom for many cell phone companies, (these services are free, that is why) many successful companies have come to the top promoting it.
