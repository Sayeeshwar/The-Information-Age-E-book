        <p><b>Online shopping:</b><br><br>

I can safely say that almost all of us have shopped online at some point of time. Some of the most popular websites include eBay, Amazon and Flipkart (India). They all have a wide range of products and are designed to be user friendly and attractive. The websites can also be used as mobile apps, making it even more convenient to use their services. <br><br>Users can browse products from the comfort of their home and have it delivered to their doorstep. Local businesses can have a wide audience without having a large and posh showroom. Also, the customer can track the location of the prodcut they ordered. However, users cannot physically try the product before buying it and it is often cumbersome to exchange faulty goods. This is often prevented by having an online customer service. While shopping, all shopping websites will need your bank card details. This can be a potential danger as there have been various occurrences of cyber attacks.  <br><br>But, the benefits far outweigh the problems as they occur very rarely.</p>
